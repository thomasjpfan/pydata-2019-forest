# Do You Want To Build a Forest?

scikit-learn provides two popular ways to build tree ensembles: Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) and Random Forests. In version 0.21, scikit-learn introduced its own Histogram-based GBDT inspired by LightGBM. In this talk, we will learn the underpinnings of GBDT and Random Forests, the differences between them, how each algorithm is optimized in scikit-learn, and how to interpret them.
